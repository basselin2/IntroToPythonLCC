    "### Programming Exercises: Problem 2 (Phonebook Database)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Write a program that creates a database named phonebook.db. The database should have a table named Entries with columns for a person’s name and phone number. Next, write a CRUD application that lets the user add rows to the Entries table, look up a person’s phone number, change a person’s phone number, and delete specified rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n",
    "**Overview:** This assignment requires the programmer to set up a database with one table that contains 2+ columns. I plan to split the first and last names into separate columns. The programmer must then create a program with multiple methods for adding a record to the database, looking up a record, editing a record, and deleting a record. I intend to make the deletion method a logical delete, which means that the record will still exist, but it will have a T/F column that will be used to exclude deleted records in the lookup method."
